# Calculator app

This is a basic React app that was meant to get us familiarized with React.

The time given to work on this app was 1.5 days, so naturally it is unfinshed.

I later took this code as a base to build a fully functioning calculator app written in TypeScript (https://github.com/btaskinen/calculator-app).
