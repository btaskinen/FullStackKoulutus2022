# Quiz App

This App was the main project of the Full Stack Developer course.

The app connects React Frontend with a Postgres database through a Node.js Express server.

The app requires user authentication and has two types of users: basic user and admin. Basic users can take the quizzes. Admin users can create, edit and delete quizzes. The admin user also has the option to have basic user view.

Data handling is done using useReducer.
